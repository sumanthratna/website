        "contents": "<p>I'm a macOS user. I really only have one complaint (it's actually very minor): there's no simple default login icon, like the typical lifeless gray/white/blue person. I decided that I wanted my icon to completely blend in with the login background. There was only one problem&mdash;I had no idea how to do this. </p> <p>I decided to actually figure this out since the red rose was bothering me. I came up with the following (horribly inefficient) psuedocode/algorithm to do this: <ol> <li>take a screenshot of the login page and name it <code>log.png</code></li> <li>take a screenshot of your home page and name it <code>desk.png</code></li> <li>in Preview, use the ellipse selection tool to select the current/bad icon in <code>log.png</code></li> <li>in Preview, copy the icon with &#8984;-C, paste it onto <code>desk.png</code>, and save this to a new file called <code>newdesk.png</code></li> <li>in Python, subtract <code>newdesk</code> and <code>desk</code> (this should leave an image array with many zeroes and some non-zero numbers where the old icon was)&mdash;name this new array <code>sub</code></li> <li>in Python, convert <code>sub</code> into a binary mask by setting all non-zero pixels to 1, name the mask <code>mask</code></li> <li>load either <code>log</code> or <code>desk</code> (your choice) into a variable named <code>final</code> and set <code>final</code> to zero when <code>mask</code> is 0</li> <li>save <code>final</code> to <code>final.png</code></li> <li>in Preview, use the ellipse selection tool to select the new/good icon in <code>final.png</code>, click crop, and save this to a new file called <code>icon.png</code></li> </ol> </p> <p> This resulted in the following Python code (<code>numpy 1.18.2</code> and <code>Pillow 7.1.1</code>):<br> <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/sumanthratna/8958b9e62f61cc3b9746e3f79634ee5d.js?file=user_icon.py\"></script> </p> <p> I'm sure this can be made much more efficient with advanced N-dimensional array indexing, but that usually sacrifices code readability. Please contact me if you have ideas on how to make this faster! Note: the final product isn't perfect. </p>"
